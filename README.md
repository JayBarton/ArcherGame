A small 2d platformer, inspired by the arrow Kirby ability.

Can you collect all 4 gems and make your way through every level?

Move with the left and right arrow keys

Crouch with the down key

Jump with the W key. Hold for higher jumps!

Fire arrow with the Q key. Hold to charge for a stronger shot!
Use the arrow keys to aim your shot
